    <p>Hold up there, Kiddo. Listen, this isn't like any other text adventure game.</p>
    <p> This game is HISTORICAL FICTION. This is about the FASTEST RACER TO EVER GRACE THE WEST. </p>
    <p> THIS IS LIKE A REAL RACE. YOU CAN'T GO BACK! You have to STICK to your decisions. And don't even THINK about reloading the webpage </p>
    <p> It will take the perfect combination of being safe and taking risks to win the game. You ready? </p>
